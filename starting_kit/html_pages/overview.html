<h1>Solve Xporters traffic volume problem</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by the ChaLearn</h3>
<p>As a young and disruptive entrepreuneur, you have just acquired a small lemonade stand located next to an highway. The previous owner of the stand told you: "I noticed that, on average, 1 car out of 100 stops at my stand".</p>
<p>Hopefully, during the last years, he also kept track of the hourly number cars that used this highway, and he gladly accepted to give you his precious records.</p>
<p>Since lemons rot fast and you want to avoid waste, you would like to use this data to train a model that predicts the traffic volume. You also found the hourly meteo records of the last years.</p>
<p>Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to predict the number of cars that will pass by at a given date, hour, and additional meteorological informations.</p>
<p>The dataset contains 58 features and the solution is the number of cars registred in an hour ranging from 0 to 7280. 
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. </p>
